Little API to extract an article content from URL or HTML (Like News content).
This is my first public repository so please be kind ;)

## How to begin

Download VS project and compile !

## How to use it

`ArticleContentExtractor.GetArticleContentFromURL("http://awesome.article.com");`
Yes... That's all I can think of...
